# CMD2 Advanced Application Examples

This project aims to help budding cmd2 application designers with more advanced techniques and nuances of the cmd2 framework. 


## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. Any additional cmd2 apps must be runnable and contain a requirements.txt file. This will help users understand which version of cmd2 the application is compatible with. I will gladly accept style changes for readability as it is imperative that example code make sense to a large audience.
